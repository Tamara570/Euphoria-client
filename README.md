EUPHORIA

About
We started the Farmers Bazaar for people living during the pandemic .For the immunocompromised it's difficult to get fresh produce from local farms with exposing risk of exposure. We wanted to give people a way to not feel panicked and anxious every time they wanted to go out to the farmers market.
